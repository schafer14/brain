Many schools are emphasising routine, right answers and standardisation. These goals are detrimental to the motivation of children and students. 

When children are doing homework ask them these three questions:

- Am I offering the children autonomy over how and when they work?
- Does this assignment promote mastery by offering novel and engaging tasks?
- Do my children understand the purpose of this assignment?

Have a FedEx day: Set aside an entire day and ask the children to come up with a problem they would like to solve. In advance help them collect the tools, information, and supplies they will need. Then let them solve the problem on their own. The next day ask them to deliver a report to the family on how they did.

Make a DIY report card: At the beginning of a semester ask the children what their top learning goals are. Then at the end of the semester ask them to create a report on their progress.

Give children an allowance and some chores, but do not combine them. Do not create an if-then motivational structure that will reduce the intrinsic motivation of doing chores. The chores are a moral family obligation, not a transactional option.

When offering praise:

- Praise effort and strategy not result or intelligence
- Make praise specific
- Praise in private: Praise is feedback, not ceremony so it is best in a one-on-one scenario.
- Offer praise only when it is deserved

Help children see the bigger picture when doing homework, ask questions like:

- Why are you learning this?
- How is it relevant to the world we live in?

Then get out of the house and apply what the homework is teaching in the real world.

Ask the children what they want to learn, and give them some time to spend learning that.

Turn students into teachers: Ask the children to teach the parents something they’re proud of learning. Then once they’ve done that invite a larger audience of family, classmates, students, and friends and ask the children to teach the larger audience.
